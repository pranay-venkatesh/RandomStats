# AUC Any function

So...I wasn't really satisfied with my earlier AUC tool, because it didn't let the user have much freedom. Well, all that has changed with my new AUC tool.
Now, you can type in any function (so long as it's syntactically correct in Java, with a semicolon, mind you) and voila! It will give you the area, so long as you choose some reasonable limits.

The most challenging part of this was trying to figure out how to get the computer to program itself, essentially. I made it write the required function to a file, but it still didn't give me a desired result. So, I decided to employ the compiler class and now it works like a charm.
The functio.java file will constantly change as per the required function entered into the main program, so be very wary of that.

Enjoy!
