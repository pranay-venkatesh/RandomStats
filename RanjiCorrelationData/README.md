# Ranji Correlation Data

Simple program to calculate the correlation r value for Ranji Trophy final wins and Ranji Trophy final toss wins.

All the wins and toss wins are stored in a file called RanjiData.txt

Wherever the asterisk '*' mark is placed near the name, it used to indicate that the match was won by first innings lead.

Correlation is calculated using two variables x and y. x contains the win data. So, if the match was won properly, then 2 points are assigned to x. If it's first innings lead, then then only 1 point.
y is simply the data marking whether the tosswin and the matchwin were the same team.

All data taken from Wikipedia.
