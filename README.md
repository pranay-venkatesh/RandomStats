# Ranji Correlation

After watching the reason Ranji Trophy finals, it occurred to me that there is a strong connection between winning the toss in the finals and winning the match. So, I quickly wrote a Java program to use Pearson's Correlation Formula to find out whether there is a correlation between winning Ranji Finals and winning the toss in Ranji Finals.

It chews data from a file containing various matchwins + tosswins for different season and spits out one line of text
