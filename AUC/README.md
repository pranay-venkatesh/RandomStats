# An important calculator: Area under the curve and Weighted averages

I needed an area under the curve and weighted average calculator for a small project of mine, so I decided to make a simple program to compute it.


# Area under the curve

Simple concept. The program does a brute force calculation of the summation of the function times the small change in the function value. It turns out to be quite accurate.
If you solve this integral: exp (-x^2) from -inf to inf, you get the value of the integral as pi/root2.

On using the area-under-the-curve calculator you get the value as:
